- :rule: "The README should explain what the library/app does, in one line"
  :why: "Summarizing things in one line is helpful"

  :why: "Because not everyone knows what needs to be done, even if it's just `gem install`"
- :rule: "The README should show the simplest example possible of using the library/ap"
  :why: "This, along with the description allows someone to understand your library/app in under a minute"
- :rule: "A more detailed overview, pointing to key classes or modules"
  :why: "When rendered as RDoc, these classes link to where the user should start reading to get a deeper perspective"
- :rule: "Additional info for developing with the code"
  :why: "If you want contributions, developers need to know how to work with your code"

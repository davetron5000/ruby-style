- :rule: "Avoid hooks"
  :why: "Hooks make your models very hard to use in different ways, and lock them to business rules that are likely not all that hard and fast.  They also make testing very difficult, as it becomes harder and harder to set up the correct state using objects that have excessive hooks on them."
  :example: |
    # Wrong; we've hidden business logic behind a simple CRUD operation
    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
      after_save :update_facebook

    private

      def update_facebook
        # send Facebook some status update 
      end
    end

    # Better; we have a method that says what it does
    class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    
      def save_and_update_facebook
        if save
          # Send Facebook some status update
        end
      end
    end

- :rule: "Conditional validations should be used with care"
  :why: "Validations that are not always applicable make it very hard to modify objects and enhance them, because it becomes increasingly difficult to understand what a valid object really is.  Further, it becomes very difficult to set up objects in a particular state for a given test if there are a lot of conditonal validations"
- :rule: "Use database constraints to enforce valid data in the database"
  :why: "The database is the only place that can truly ensure various constraints, such as uniqueness.  Constraints are incredibly useful for making sure that, regardless of bugs in your code, your data will be clean."
- :rule: "AR objects should be as dumb as possible; only derived values should be new methods"
  :why: "It may be tempting to add business logic to your models, but this violates the single responsibility principle, and makes the classes harder and harder to understand, test, and modify.  Treat your models as dumb structs with persistence, and put all other concerns on other classes.  Do not just mix in a bunch of modules."
